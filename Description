I need to create a counter that can count the bowls and overs per innings

There are six bowls per over
notation is displayed as 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0, 1.1, ... 49.5, 50
After team 1 has had 50 overs, then team 2 gets 50 overs

Ideally, each bowl would occur no longer than 5 seconds apart, but the first upgrade would be for a button that forces the counter to increase
